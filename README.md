# Talkie Gen AI - Appwrite Migration

This repository contains the Talkie Gen AI application with secure Appwrite function integration for AI API calls.

## 🔐 Security Improvement

**Before**: API key was exposed in client-side JavaScript (security risk)
**After**: API key is securely stored in Appwrite function environment variables

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Current State (Development Mode)
The application currently runs in development mode with a fallback to direct API calls. This allows testing while you set up Appwrite.

### 2. Deploy to Appwrite
Follow the detailed instructions in [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) to:
1. Create an Appwrite project
2. Deploy the AI function
3. Update the client configuration
4. Remove the API key from client-side code

### 3. Production Ready
After following the deployment guide, your application will be secure with server-side API handling.
