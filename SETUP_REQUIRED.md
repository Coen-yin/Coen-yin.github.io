# 🔐 IMPORTANT: Setup Instructions for Repository Owner

## What Has Been Done

Your API key has been secured! The hardcoded API key has been removed from `script.js` and replaced with a secure build-time injection system.

## ⚠️ REQUIRED SETUP STEPS

You **MUST** complete these steps for the site to work:

### 1. Set Up GitHub Environment Secret

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/Coen-yin/Coen-yin.github.io
2. **Click on "Settings"** (in the repository menu)
3. **Navigate to "Environments"** (left sidebar)
4. **Create or edit the "github-pages" environment**:
   - Click "New environment" if it doesn't exist
   - Name it exactly: `github-pages`
5. **Add the secret**:
   - Click "Add secret"
   - Name: `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - Value: `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`
   - Click "Add secret"

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Settings → Pages**
2. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
3. **Save the settings**

### 3. Trigger Deployment

1. **Merge this PR** to the main branch
2. **The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically**:
   - Build the site with your API key injected securely
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Your site will be live at: https://coen-yin.github.io

## ✅ What This Accomplishes

- 🔒 **API key is secure**: Never appears in source code
- 🚀 **Automated deployment**: Updates automatically when you push changes
- 🛡️ **Access control**: Only repo admins can see/modify the API key
- 📝 **Clean history**: No sensitive data in git commits
- 🔧 **Local development**: Use `dev-setup.sh` for testing locally

## 🚨 If You Skip These Steps

- Your site will not work (API calls will fail)
- Users will see error messages
- The chat functionality will be broken
